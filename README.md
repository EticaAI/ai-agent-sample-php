# Sample Project with PHP of Inteligent Agent

The purpose of this repository is to create the minimum bootstrap of an
[intelligent agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent), which can
use libraries of other developers so that **it can be tested within the
Etica.AI infrastructure**.

This means that the **code here will be a sample, not a complete functional
product**. It can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to collaborate.
